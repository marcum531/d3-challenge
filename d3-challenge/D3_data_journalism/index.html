          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>As poverty levels increase, the percentage of obesity increases, particularly in many 
            of the southern states, such as Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The
            percentage of people without healthcare also increases. This can also be seen in several of the
            southern states, such as Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The percentage of smokers
            increases as poverty levels increase.  Again this can be seen in several of the southern states, 
            including West Virginia and Kentucky.
          </p>

          <p>As the median age increases, the percentage of people who are considered obese increases. This 
            same trend can be seen in the percentage of smokers.  The younger population tend to not smoke and 
            maintain a healthy weight. Meanwhile, the younger population tend not to have healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>As the median household income increases, the percentage of people without healthcare 
            tends to decrease. This same trend can be seen with the percentage of smokers and the 
            percentage of the population who are obese. Households with higher incomes generally are 
            not smokers, maintaining a healthy weight, and can afford to have healthcare coverage.
